# Birthday Countdown ðŸŽ‚ðŸŽ‰
## Description
This is a simple yet fun countdown timer that counts down to 6th Julyâ€”the big day(My bday haha)! ðŸŽˆ <br>
Built using HTML, with a touch of CSS for styling and JavaScript to handle the timer.<br>

### Features
âœ… Fixed Target Date: Countdown is set for 6th July'25.<br>
âœ… Live Countdown: Updates every second.<br>
âœ… Minimal & Aesthetic UI: Simple yet fun design.<br>
âœ… Lightweight: Uses only HTML, CSS, and JSâ€”no external libraries.<br>

### How It Works
JavaScript calculates the time difference between the current time and 6th July.<br>
The page updates every second to show the remaining days, hours, minutes, and seconds.<br>
